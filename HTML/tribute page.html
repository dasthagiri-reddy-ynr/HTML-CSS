        <p>Ratan Tata was the son of Naval Tata, who was adopted by Ratanji Tata,
            son of Jamshedji Tata, the founder of the Tata Group. He graduated from
            Cornell University College of Architecture with a bachelor's degree in
            architecture.He joined the Tata Group in 1961 starting on the shop floor
            of Tata Steel. He later succeeded J. R. D. Tata as chairman of Tata Sons
            upon the latter's retirement in 1991. During his tenure, the Tata Group
            acquired Tetley, Jaguar, Land Rover, and Corus, in an attempt to turn
            Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business. Tata
            was also a philanthropist.

        <p>Tata invested in over 30 start-ups, most in a personal capacity
